I'm happy to announce that I'll be speaking at [wroc_love.rb](http://www.wrocloverb.com/), which will take place on March 10 & 11 in Wrocław, Poland. It's going to be a fun little conference (about 250 attendees if I'm not mistaken) and features a line-up with speakers such as Avdi Grimm and Jim Gay. Find a short description of my talk below.
