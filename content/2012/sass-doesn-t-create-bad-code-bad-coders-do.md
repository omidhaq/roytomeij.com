excerpt: "Those who don’t see any use for pre-processors such as Sass often use the “bad code” argumentation. It creates too specific selectors due to nesting, huge sprites and they hate the way Sass enforces an architectural approach that doesn’t work. And it’s all true. If you’re a poor developer. You know, one who would handcraft too specific selectors, 15MB sprites and doesn’t know how to cleanly structure a project."

I'm no fan of cross-posting, but I feel so strongly about this one that I just _need_ to point you to [my article on The Sass Way](http://thesassway.com/articles/sass-doesnt-create-bad-code-bad-coders-do), in which I debunk some arguments against using Sass. Sorry if you were expecting the essay here: it's just one click/tap away.
