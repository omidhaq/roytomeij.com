title: "Static site using nanoc"
---

%p This site now runs on <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>, a static site generator running on Ruby. The old Wordpress install went out the window and I only migrated two posts; the ones that people are likely to land on via search engines. I chose a static site because that's what all the cool kids have. Besides that I was pretty much done with showing my latest tweet, etc. Just go to <a href="http://www.teitter.com/roy">Twitter</a> if you want to know. A static site also saves me from any possible security issues (it's all just HTML) and updates to Wordpress and its plugins.
%p For syntax highlighting I use the <a href="http://coderay.rubychan.de/">CodeRay</a> gem, based on instruction in <a href="http://austinbirch.co.uk/posts/syntax_highlighting_in_nanoc.html">this post</a> and some Googling. This site is open source, so if you want you may just clone it at <a href="https://github.com/roytomeij/roytomeij.com">GitHub</a>.
%p As for actual blogging: we'll see how that goes...
